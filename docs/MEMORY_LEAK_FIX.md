# ðŸ§  Memory Leak Fix - COMPLETE

## Critical Issue Fixed
**BEFORE**: Price history grew indefinitely causing memory leaks and eventual system crashes
**AFTER**: Smart memory management with automatic cleanup and monitoring

## What Was Fixed
1. **Smart Memory Manager**: Intelligent price history with automatic cleanup
2. **Symbol Limits**: Maximum symbols enforced to prevent unbounded growth
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Inactive symbols removed automatically
4. **Strategy Protection**: Important symbols protected from cleanup
5. **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking and alerts
6. **Efficient Storage**: Compact data storage using deque and shortened keys
7. **Thread Safety**: All operations are thread-safe
8. **API Monitoring**: Endpoints to monitor and control memory usage

## Files Changed
- `src/core/memory_manager.py` (NEW) - Smart memory management system
- `src/core/strategies.py` - Updated to use smart memory management
- `src/engine/production_engine.py` - Added memory monitoring endpoints
- `requirements.txt` - Added psutil for memory monitoring

## Testing
Run: `python test_memory_fix.py`

## Status: âœ… CRITICAL MEMORY LEAK FIXED
Memory leak vulnerability completely eliminated with smart management.
