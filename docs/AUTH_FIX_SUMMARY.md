# üîê Authentication Security Fix - COMPLETE

## Critical Issue Fixed
**BEFORE**: Authentication completely bypassed - anyone could access any user's account
**AFTER**: Secure JWT-based authentication with rate limiting and validation

## What Was Fixed
1. **JWT Authentication**: Replaced hardcoded user return with proper JWT validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests/minute per IP, 5 login attempts per 15 minutes  
3. **Token Management**: Access tokens (30min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
4. **Security Headers**: Added XSS, clickjacking, and MIME type protection
5. **Permission System**: Token-based permissions for fine-grained access

## New API Usage
```bash
# 1. Login to get JWT token
POST /auth/login
{
  "api_key": "your-api-key",
  "user_id": "trader_001"
}

# 2. Use JWT token for protected endpoints
GET /user/dashboard
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

## Files Changed
- `src/core/auth.py` (NEW) - Secure authentication module
- `src/engine/production_engine.py` - Updated endpoints with JWT validation
- `requirements.txt` - Added PyJWT + cryptography

## Testing
Run: `python test_auth_fix.py`

## Status: ‚úÖ CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FIXED
Authentication bypass vulnerability completely eliminated.
