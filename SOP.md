# Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

1. Ensure PostgreSQL and Redis are running.
2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file.
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. Set up a production environment with PostgreSQL and Redis.
2. Configure environment variables for production.
3. Use a production-grade server (e.g., Gunicorn) to run the application.

## Testing

1. Run tests using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up test
   ```
2. Review test logs for any failures or warnings.

## Adding a New Feature

1. Create a new branch for the feature.
2. Implement the feature, including tests.
3. Run tests to ensure everything passes.
4. Submit a pull request for review.

## Managing Database Migrations

1. Create a new migration:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
   ```
2. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
3. Rollback migrations if necessary:
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```

## Handling Common Errors

- **Database Connection Issues**: Check the connection string and ensure the database is running.
- **Redis Connection Issues**: Verify Redis is running and the connection string is correct.
- **Test Failures**: Review test logs for detailed error messages and fix accordingly.

## Updating Dependencies

1. Update `requirements.txt` with new dependencies.
2. Install updated dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run tests to ensure compatibility.

## Creating New Strategies

1. **Define the Strategy**:

   - Clearly outline the strategy's logic, inputs, and expected outputs.
   - Document any dependencies or external services required.

2. **Implement the Strategy**:

   - Create a new module or class for the strategy in the `app/strategies/` directory.
   - Ensure the strategy follows the existing code style and conventions.

3. **Write Tests**:

   - Create unit tests for the strategy in `app/tests/`.
   - Ensure tests cover all edge cases and expected behaviors.

4. **Integrate with Order Processing**:

   - Update the `OrderHandler` or relevant components to use the new strategy.
   - Ensure the strategy is properly integrated with the order creation and processing flow.

5. **Deploy and Monitor**:

   - Deploy the updated application to the desired environment.
   - Monitor the strategy's performance and logs for any issues.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update the README.md or relevant documentation to include details about the new strategy.
   - Provide examples of how to use the strategy in the application.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Set Up Logging**:

   - Use Python's `logging` module to log important events and errors.
   - Configure log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR) and log formats in `app/core/logging.py`.

2. **Monitor Application Performance**:

   - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application metrics (e.g., response times, error rates).
   - Set up alerts for critical issues (e.g., high error rates, slow response times).

3. **Log Analysis**:

   - Use log aggregation tools (e.g., ELK Stack, Graylog) to analyze logs and identify patterns or issues.
   - Regularly review logs to ensure the application is running smoothly.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Log meaningful messages with context (e.g., order ID, user ID).
   - Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys).
   - Rotate logs to manage disk space and ensure logs are retained for a reasonable period.
