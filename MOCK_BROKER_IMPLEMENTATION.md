# Mock Broker Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete mock broker system that integrates with the OMS to receive signals, access live market data from Redis streams, and execute order matching based on real-time prices.

## Architecture Flow
```
Signal → OMS (subscriber.py) → Order Manager → Mock Broker → Live Tick Data (Redis Streams)
                                                      ↓
                                              Order Matching Engine
                                                      ↓
                                              Update Order Status → Database
```

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. MockBroker Class (`order/mock_broker.py`)
- **Market Data Integration**: Connects to Redis streams to access live tick data
- **Order Matching Logic**: 
  - BUY orders: Fill when ask price <= signal price
  - SELL orders: Fill when bid price >= signal price
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background tasks for market data consumption and order matching
- **Order State Management**: Tracks orders from PENDING → PLACED → FILLED/REJECTED
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeout for orders that can't be filled

### 2. Updated OrderManager (`order/manager.py`)
- **Mock Broker Integration**: Uses MockBroker when `paper_trading=True`
- **Unified Interface**: Same interface for both mock and real brokers
- **Status Synchronization**: Automatically updates order status from mock broker
- **Database Persistence**: Saves order state transitions to database

### 3. Configuration (`env.template`)
- **MOCK_BROKER_TIMEOUT**: How long to try matching before timeout (default: 60s)
- **MOCK_BROKER_RETRY_INTERVAL**: How often to check for matches (default: 0.5s)

## Key Features

### Real-Time Market Data Access
- Subscribes to `market_data_stream:{symbol}` Redis streams
- Maintains buffer of latest ticks per symbol
- Uses consumer groups for reliable message processing

### Intelligent Order Matching
- **BUY Orders**: Fills at ask price when ask <= signal price
- **SELL Orders**: Fills at bid price when bid >= signal price
- **Continuous Retry**: Keeps trying until filled or timeout
- **Realistic Execution**: Uses actual market bid/ask prices

### Order Lifecycle Management
- **PENDING**: Order received from signal
- **PLACED**: Order submitted to mock broker
- **FILLED**: Order matched with market price
- **REJECTED**: Order couldn't be filled (timeout/other issues)

### Database Integration
- Updates order status in database at each state transition
- Maintains order history and fill details
- Syncs with existing order management system

## Testing
- Created `test_mock_broker.py` for testing the implementation
- Tests order placement, status monitoring, and completion
- Verifies order matching logic with real market data

## Usage
The mock broker automatically activates when `PAPER_TRADING=true` in the environment. It will:
1. Receive orders from the OMS
2. Subscribe to market data for relevant symbols
3. Continuously attempt to match orders with live prices
4. Update order status and persist to database
5. Provide realistic order execution simulation

## Benefits
- **Realistic Simulation**: Uses actual market data for order matching
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing OMS without changes
- **Configurable**: Timeout and retry intervals can be adjusted
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple orders and symbols efficiently
- **Reliable**: Uses Redis consumer groups for robust message processing
